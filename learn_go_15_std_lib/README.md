# Division Of The Packages From Easiest To Advanced

<!-- https://pkg.go.dev/std -->

**Easier Concepts:**

1. `fmt`
2. `bufio`
3. `strings`
4. `strconv`
5. `errors`
6. `os`
7. `io`
8. `time`
9. `math`
10. `sync`

**Intermediate Concepts:**

11. `net`
12. `http`

**Advanced Concepts (might not be covered in beginner tutorials but good to know about):**

13. `compress`
14. `context`
15. `crypto`
16. `database`
17. `flag`
18. `html`
19. `image`
20. `unicode`

**Less Relevant for Beginners:**

21. `debug`
22. `embed`
23. `expvar`
24. `go`
25. `hash`
26. `index`
27. `runtime`
28. `syscall`
29. `unsafe`

Remember, this division is subjective and can vary based on individual preferences and learning pace. Start with the easier concepts and gradually move on to more intermediate and advanced ones as you become more comfortable with the language. The most important thing is to build a strong foundation and gradually expand your knowledge as you gain experience.

If your aim is to become a backend developer, your focus should be on the packages and concepts that are more relevant to backend development. Here's a suggested priority list based on the packages you provided, with a focus on backend development:

**Foundational Concepts:**

1. `fmt`: Essential for printing formatted output, which is useful for debugging and logging in backend applications.

2. `errors`: Crucial for handling errors, which is a common task in backend development.

3. `os`: Important for interacting with the operating system, working with files, and managing environment variables.

4. `io`: Useful for input/output operations, which are common when dealing with files and network connections.

**Intermediate Concepts:**

5. `net`: Vital for network programming, including creating network connections and working with IP addresses.

6. `http`: Essential for building HTTP servers and clients, a core part of backend development.

**Backend-Specific Concepts:**

7. `database`: Important for interacting with databases using SQL, a key aspect of backend development.

8. `flag`: Valuable for parsing command-line flags, which is useful for configuring backend applications.

9. `time`: Useful for working with dates, times, and durations, which is often needed for backend tasks.

**Advanced Concepts (Good to Be Aware Of):**

10. `compress`: Helpful for compression and decompression, which might be used for optimizing data transfer.

11. `context`: Important for managing context in concurrent programs, which is relevant in building scalable backend systems.

12. `crypto`: Useful for handling cryptographic operations, relevant for security-related aspects of backend development.

**Less Relevant for Backend Developers:**

Packages related to graphical and low-level operations (e.g., `image`, `unicode`, `runtime`) might not be as directly relevant to backend development.

Remember that backend development involves creating and maintaining server-side applications that handle data, communication, and business logic. As a backend developer, you'll often work with databases, APIs, and networking. Focus on mastering the packages and concepts that directly relate to these tasks. Additionally, gaining knowledge in web frameworks, database interaction, RESTful APIs, and deployment will be crucial for your backend development journey.
